Linear regression is a basic yet super powerful machine learning algorithm.It is a supervised learning model used for prediction and for explaining the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable .The most basic form of linear regression deals with dataset of a single feature per data point.


## Lasso & Ridge Regression 

Regularization techniques such as lasso and ridge regression overcome some of the problems of OLS(Ordinary Least Squares). These are some of the simple techniques to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression.

Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients estimates towards zero, in this way improving the variability, reducing the variance while slightly increasing the bias and raising the overall accuracy of the model.

Another regularization technique called lasso improves both accuracy and model interpretability by selecting which coefficients to shrink and by shrinking some of them exactly to zero
